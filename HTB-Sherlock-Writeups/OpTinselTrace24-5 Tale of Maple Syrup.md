Identifying IOCs, accounts, or infrastructure is crucial for detecting breaches by attackers. Determine the email address used by the threat actor so it can be added to Santa's threat intel feed.

	Intiail analysis we are given a mobile image of an android device. Poking around I came across this file: C:\School\HTB\DFIR\TaleOfMapleSyrup\OPTT5-TRIAGE\data\mega.privacy.android.app\karere-MTJuaktENGh5RUnknsfFX1h0-2fcJ12pbmOW.db

### **Question 10**
Twinkle forgot the password of the archive file he sent to Krampus containing secrets. What was the password for the file?

	What helped me here was looking at context clues. First, I found the file in question where they zipped up the zipping(1).png and noticed they used ZipCrypto. I did some research on that and it uses legacy zip encryption process.
	
	Doing some research on tools to crack this old zip encryption I found bkcrack. Took me a bit to setup but once I understaood the tool which it needs the zip file, file to crack within zip archive, and a plaintext file to use for cracking it can crack it

### **Question 11**
What is the master password of the KeePass database that was leaked by the insider threat and handed over to the evil Krampus?

	Since the Keepass database file comes in a KDBX file we will use keepass2john tool which converts those files into a password cracking file compatible with John The Ripper. First we will want to extract the hash from the keepass file and save it to a file. After extracting the hash we can now use john the ripper and to get the password.

**Answer**:
